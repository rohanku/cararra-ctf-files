# CararraCTF

A [collection](https://cararra-ctf.netlify.app/) of around 100 challenges centered around algorithms, cybersecurity, and other miscellaneous computer science challenges. Built with React.js, Cloud Firestore, and Node.js and deployed using Netlify and Heroku. Served a new challenge daily to around 200 total users.

CararraCTF ran for 5 rounds of 20 challenges each. Archives of previous round sites can be found below.
- [Round 1](https://r1--cararra-ctf.netlify.app/challenges): Dynamic programming, shortest path algorithms, password cracking, broadcast attacks, XSS, Bash scripts, segment trees.
- [Round 2](https://r2--cararra-ctf.netlify.app/): Git, clustering, tiling, websockets, chosen plaintext attacks, reversing, cookies, JWTs, web scraping.
- [Round 3](https://r3--cararra-ctf.netlify.app/): Number theory, binary search, forensics, OCR, string algorithms, web crawling, HTTP requests, greedy algorithms, padding oracle attacks, AES-CBC.
- [Round 4](https://r4--cararra-ctf.netlify.app/): Sweep line algorithms, terminal commands, inversion counting, code injection, Ghidra, sparse tables, stack smashing, lazy propagation, ROP.
- [Round 5](https://r5--cararra-ctf.netlify.app/): Tree algorithms, diffs, image steganography, SQL, meet-in-the-middle attacks, longest increasing subsequence, replay attacks, combinatorial optimization.

The source code for the file server is available in this repo. Exploitable files, programs, websockets, and servers were built with Node.js and deployed using Heroku. Frontend source code can be found at https://github.com/rohanku/cararra-ctf.
